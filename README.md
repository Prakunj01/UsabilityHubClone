Description - "UsabilityHub Website Clone"<br> <br>
This project is a clone of the UsabilityHub website, built using HTML and CSS with the Flexbox layout model. It showcases my ability to recreate a complex and responsive web page, demonstrating proficiency in HTML and CSS concepts such as layout structure and styling. The clone closely mimics the visual appearance and design elements of the original website, allowing users to experience the interface and functionality in a simulated environment. The project serves as a testament to my front-end development skills and understanding of modern web design principles.
